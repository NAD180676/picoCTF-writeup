Description:

Morse code is well known. Can you decrypt this?
Download the file here (https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/79/morse_chal.wav).
Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.

This challenge can be solved easily with tools online.
If you are an expert at morse code, then this will be a good chance to use your special ability (I've learned multiple times but could never remember;(, if you can, then you're very impressive, keep it up!), if not, then well folks let's seek help from tools.

After we downloaded the file, there will be a 28 seconds long audio, I used "https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html" to decode the audio.

The result is: "WH47 H47H 90D W20U9H7"

so the flag will be in picoCTF{} format, replace space with underscore and words are lowercase:


picoCTF{wh47_h47h_90d_w20u9h7}
